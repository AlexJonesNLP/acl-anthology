## Instructions

Please remove this text and describe the changes you require.

You can speed up metadata corrections by submitting your own pull requests.
Metadata is generated from [our XML data](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/tree/master/data/xml).
To find the XML file for the paper you want to correct, look at its Anthology ID.
For example:
* (new ID format, 2020+) 2020.acl-main.17 -> [2020.acl.xml](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/blob/master/data/xml/2020.acl.xml)
* (old ID format) W18-6319 -> [W18.xml](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/blob/master/data/xml/W18.xml)
