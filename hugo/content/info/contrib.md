This page contains general information for conference publication chairs detailing how to package up your proceedings and deliver them to the Anthology.
This delivery is the last stage of the conference management process, information about which can be found [in this document](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-pub).)
Please read through it so that you have an understanding of the ingestion process.

Please note that chairs of workshops colocated with a larger conference should work through their conference publication chair instead of directly with the Anthology.

### Register your meeting

Please register your meeting by having the main conferene publications chair contact the Anthology director via email.
This should be done as soon as possible in the conference process, ideally once the complete list of volumes (main conference and workshops) has been determined.
We prefer you to send this information in the form of a spreadsheet with the following information for each volume:

-  **The full title**.
-  **A short title**.
-  **The venue code** or abbreviation, e.g., ("ACL", "RepL4NLP")

Additionally, please let us know **The date** you would like your volumes to be available to the world.
(Your proceedings will be due no later than **two weeks** prior to this negotiated date).

An excellent spreadsheet example [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F1XhnT4PsiN-ZXcpv6QUp5A2qlr6-W9MoDgCkBOw9w/edit#gid=0)).
% https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxReqK6CkqdJPvC3en6USQj8FFg8zyiA5i4gGr-_tFA/edit#gid=0


All publications chairs need to obtain or verify [the venue identifiers]({{< relref "ids.md" >}}) for proceedings submitted to the Anthology.

If you are chairing a meeting attached as a satellite of a main conference (e.g., ACL or EMNLP), please work with the main conference publication chair to receive your identifiers.
(If you are an established venue, you can also look yours up [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/blob/master/data/yaml/venues.yaml).)

If you are a conference publications chair, you must register your intention to submit your proceedings.
Assemble the following information for all volumes and workshops in their conference and send it to [the Anthology Director](mailto:anthology@aclweb.org) in a single email.
We need the following information from you:

-  **The full titles of all volumes** (main conference and workshop) that you need venue codes for  ([excellent example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F1XhnT4PsiN-ZXcpv6QUp5A2qlr6-W9MoDgCkBOw9w/edit#gid=0)); and
-  **The date** you would like your volumes to be available to the world.
   (Your proceedings will be due **two weeks** prior to this negotiated date).

The full titles should not contain abbreviations, except parenthetically.
For example, "Proceedings of EMNLP 2019" is not a good title, but "Proceedings of the 2019 Meeting of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)" is a great one.
If you have sub-volumes (e.g., long papers, short papers, demonstrations, tutorial abstracts), we suggest you append them after the full volume name.
For example, "Proceedings of the 2019 Meeting of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP): Tutorial Abstracts".
You should also seek consistency with the names of your volumes from prior years.

If your conference has satellite workshops, please make certain the workshops will actually be run.

By default, the publication of papers associated with an event in the Anthology will be on the first day of the event (inclusive of workshops or tutorials).
If you prefer to have it published on a different date, please inform us when you register.

### Submit your data

After your conference management software has collected all the camera-ready papers and associated attachments, you will arrange all the volumes of your proceedings into [ACLPUB](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB) format, as described in the [ACLPUB â†’ Anthology documentation](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/anthology).

If you used [Softconf](https://www.softconf.com)'s [STARTv2 conference management system](https://www.softconf.com/about/start-v2-mainmenu-26), the situation is easy for you, since ACLPUB is integrated.
For meetings using EasyChair, you will need to first convert to ACLPUB format using [our easy2acl scripts](https://github.com/acl-org/easy2acl).
The end result in either case is a `data` directory containing ACLPUB proceedings, one for each conference (again, see [the ACLPUB -> Anthology instructions](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/anthology)).
A link to this directory (preferably via a file sharing service, such as Dropbox or Google Drive) should be sent to the Anthology Director **two weeks prior to your desired publication date** (which was negotiated when you first contacted us).

The remaining steps are handled by Anthology staff and use [Anthology tools](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/tree/master/bin/):

- We ingest that data by running additional scripts that convert it into our authoritative format and commit it to [our Github repository](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/).
- This becomes a pull request on [our pull requests page](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/pulls).
- Once approved and merged into the `master` branch, the site will be automatically rebuilt (which happens twice a day) and made live.

### Copyright

If you are using the START system, this process is handled as part of the camera-ready submission process.

Otherwise, for copyright transfers, please use the form at:

+ https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/blob/master/doc/authors/ACL-copyright-form.pdf

Forms should be signed by authors and saved using the ACL Anthology identifiers as names.
Please place these into a folder (e.g., `copyright-transfers/P11-1001.pdf`) and then deliver them in bulk to the Anthology Editor when submitting the proceedings.

For both current and legacy events, it is good practice for the organizers to attempt to obtain copyright transfers for their materials, but we will ingest materials even if no copyright transfers are on file.

### ISBN Numbers

If you need to assign ISBN numbers, please provide the exact titles of each volume to be assigned an ISBN and forward this information to Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager.

### Errata and Corrections

If you get requests from authors needing to post errata or revised versions of the papers, or supplemental attachments after the publication of the proceedings, please refer them to [our documentation on the matter]({{< relref "corrections.md" >}}).
Note that after the publication date, corrections can only be applied to individual papers; the full proceedings volumes will not be replaced or revised.
